# Matrix training generator

This tool generates Goldstein’s matrix training tables (Goldstein, 1983), a strategy for teaching generative language skills through structured combinations of minimal units. You can generate teaching protocols based on selected minimal units and algorithms for word selection and ordering. You can target specific protocols (e.g., Hanna et al. 2011) or implement your own.

## Features

- **Interactive unit selection**:
  - Click units to select/deselect
  - Drag-and-drop reordering of selected units
  - Visual badges showing selection order

- **Customizable unit permutation tables**:
  - Toggle between default and custom row/column orders
  - Drag-and-drop reorganization of table structure
  - Multiple highlighting modes

- **Protocol generation**:
  - Work in progress
